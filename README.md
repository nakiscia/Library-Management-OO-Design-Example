## What is all about? 

This repository is an object oriented design example of a real world project. All codes are written in **Java.** This repository includes requirement lists, use case diagram, class diagram,-maybe- sequence diagram... 


## About the Project

**Library Managemenet System** is for handling the primary functions of a Library. It basicly includes some assets, collections and member management of a Library. In other words, it helps the library managements to keep track of their books, magazines and members' subscriptions and their profiles.

## System Requirements (v1)

The system will be capable of those requirements: 

 - Each book can be searched by its title, author,subject, and category.
 - Each book will have unique id number and a track number which represent the physical location of the book in the library.
 - Each book may have more than one copy and each of them can be checked-out or reservable by any library members. 
 - System should display information about book like;
	 - Details of book
	 - Checked out by whom
 - There should be configrable limit of book check out for members. 
 - There should be configrable limit on due date for book returns. 
 - The system should collect fee for returned but due date expired books.
 - Members should reserve a book which currently not avaible.
 - The system should notify via notifications members whenever a reserved book is avaible. 

## Use Case Diagram

In the Library management System there are four main actors and those are;

 - **Librarian** responsible for adding, editing books and members. S/he also responsible for reserving and returning the book. 
 - **Member** can search for a spesific book and reserve, checkout, renew and return a book.
 - **Admin** can change the configrable limitations of the system. 
 - **System** responsible for sending notifications for overdue books and avaible books.
